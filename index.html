			<div class="about-content">
				<p>I am originally from Fort Wayne Indiana. I moved to Colorado in 2012. I have a bachelor's in Psychology from Indiana University. Since moving here five years ago, I have been working in finance. Web Development has always been an interest of mine since I took a class in college and had a lot of fun learning it. I plan to use what I've learned in this class to make a change in careers and focus on Web Development from here on. </p>
				<br>
				<p>In my free time I like to watch a lot of sports. Mainly basketball, football, and a little soccer. I like to play basketball whenever I can and soccer every once in awhile. Since I've been living in Colorado for awhile now, I'm also trying to learn to snowboard.</p>
